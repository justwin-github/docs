We have provided our smart contracts in two formats:Â 

1.  A [gist](https://gist.github.com/abdullathedruid/f58f51e3253dde53c068e71864348274) that can be readily imported into remix IDE. This consists of a single flattened solidity file which you can immediately deploy and play with. Our tutorial will utilise this, and can be followed with minimal programming knowledge.

2.  Full [github repository](https://github.com/abdullathedruid/lslmsr). We expect users with some development experience will be able to utilise this to empower their own contracts. Furthermore, we would welcome any modifications to the contract.
